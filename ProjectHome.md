**jQOSK** is an on-screen keyboard plugin project for jQuery. On-screen keyboards (OSKs) provide several benefits to users:

  1. **Accessibility.** Users who cannot use physical keyboards because of mobility impairments can use OSKs to interact with Web pages and applications.
  1. **Convenience.** Users at kiosks or other environment without a physical keyboard can use OSKs to provide input to pages and applications.
  1. **Security.** OSKs circumvent the risk of key-logging when entering passwords or other secure data.

While [a number of other OSKs](PriorArt.md) already exist, the focus of the jQOSK project is to build an OSK specifically tailored for the Web that is free, accessible, easy-to-implement, and user-configurable.
